## About Me

I’ve lived in San Diego my whole life and come from a family of five.  

### My Hobbies
I enjoy playing video games with my friends, especially *Fortnite* and *Valorant*.  
Traveling is another passion of mine, and here are some of my favorite moments:

I’ve traveled outside the continent only twice, visiting England and Paris:

### Family Life
I have one brother and one sister.  
- My sister is a senior at Del Norte High School.  
- My brother is currently studying in college at Rutgers.  

### Interests
I’m an animal lover, and my favorite animal is a dog.  
In sports, I participate in track and field. I prefer running short distances like the 100m, 200m, and 400m sprints, which are my favorites.
